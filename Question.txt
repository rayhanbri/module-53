1.  What is npm?(store and manger)


npm (Node Package Manager) is the default package manager for Node.js.
It helps developers install, manage, and share JavaScript libraries and tools.

Think of npm as a store + manager for JavaScript packages.

Why do we use npm?

Instead of writing everything from scratch, we install ready-made packages.




2.what is express.js?(framework)



Express.js is a fast and minimal Node.js framework used to build web servers and RESTful APIs.

One-line difference (often asked)
Node.js → runtime
Express.js → framework built on Node.js


3.2️⃣ What is app.use()?




app.use() is used to register middleware in Express.
app.use(express.json());



4.3️⃣ Difference between req.params and req.query





req.params is used for route parameters, while req.query is used for query strings.
| Feature    | req.params           | req.query           |
| ---------- | -------------------- | ------------------- |
| Comes from | URL path             | URL query string    |
| Mandatory  | Yes                  | Optional            |
| Used for   | Identifying resource | Filtering/searching |



5.4️⃣ How does Express handle errors?




Express handles errors using error-handling middleware.

app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  res.status(500).json({ error: err.message });
});


6......Why do we use nodemon instead of node?



nodemon is a development tool for Node.js that automatically restarts the server whenever it detects changes in your project files.

It helps developers work faster and more efficiently during backend development.

node runs your server once.

nodemon runs your server and automatically restarts it when file changes are detected.

nodemon → development only

node → production


7.....what is cors why we use this?




CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a browser security mechanism that controls which frontend origins are allowed to access backend resources.

By default, browsers block requests coming from a different origin.


8.....Why browsers block cross-origin requests?

To protect users from:

Malicious websites

Data theft

Unauthorized API access

This is called the Same-Origin Policy.

Frontend: http://localhost:5173

Backend: http://localhost:5000

Different ports = different origins


9....Why do we use CORS?

We use CORS to tell the browser:

“It’s okay for this frontend to access this backend.”



10.  What is middleware?



Middleware is a function that runs between the client request and the server response.

It can:

Read or modify the request (req)

Modify the response (res)

Decide whether the request continues or stops



11.  Why middleware is used

Middleware is used to:

Parse JSON data

Authenticate users (JWT)

Log requests

Handle errors

Protect routes

Types of middleware (interview point) 4 types of middleware .

Application-level – applies to all routes

Route-level – applies to specific routes

Error-handling – handles errors
